The PC Music to Mad Decent transplant finally released his anticipated debut album, *Harlecore*, earlier this year after years of teasing through a series of parties throughout his career. *Harlecore* is more than just an album; it's a whole world Harle created in tribute to the various forms of 90's/2000's club EDM that influenced his now decade-long production career. Each track credits one of four fictional artists who make up the bill at Club Harlecore, each representing a different sound and collaboration.

The album's concept is unique and intriguing, par for the course for the PC Music roster, but the music itself doesn't hold up to the expectations that the ambitious ideas set.

The highs are very, very high on this record, the singles making up most of the standouts. "Boing Beat" by MC Boing (Harle's collab with Lil Data, an energetic pitched up English MC) is a blissful and addicting caricature of Eurotrance. "On a Mountain" and "Do You Remember" by DJ Danny (Harle himself) are ultra-polished trance anthems with hypnotic vocals by Georgia Twinn and L Devine, respectively. "Interlocked" by DJ Mayhem (Harle's collab with Hudson Mohawke) is a perfectly in-your-face hardcore track with the cleanest hardcore drum mixing job I've heard in a while. Apart from the standouts, however, many of the other tracks end up sounding like imitations of the sounds they reference. Some play it too safe, and even many standouts fall victim to the common theme of songs not feeling fleshed out enough. Most of this stems from the ultra-short duration of each song — the average length of each track doesn't even reach three minutes.

In Harle's press run for the project, he repeatedly said the best parts of dance music are the moments of "euphoria," where you're not thinking about the music and just feeling it. With each track on the record, he said he tried to find the "shortest path to euphoria."

While I respect the analysis and effort, I feel he missed the mark on what makes club EDM that way: the euphoria hits partly due to the song's length. The purpose of a DJ mix is to build up energy without ruining the flow of the dance floor, and the standards set by the long song lengths are there to achieve the same goal: to ease you to and from a trance-like state. By condensing the songs, he isn't giving you a fast track to euphoria but instead switching the hypnosis of the club floor for the energy-drink version of it: giving you only hints of the songs as each idea doesn't have much time to stay. This is even more obvious when you hear the fleshed-out extended cuts of some of *Harlecore*'s songs on [Harle's promotional mix for BBC Radio 1](https://soundcloud.com/saunter777/danny-l-harle-in-the-mix-diplo-and-friends-bbc-radio-1-rip); the longer durations lending the songs a fuller structure and more of that "euphoria."

Harle is undoubtedly a talented producer, but *Harlecore* almost puts a self-inflicted cap on his talents. The gone-too-soon moments on this project leave you wanting more, almost as if you're scrolling through someone else's social media recaps after they had a night at Club Harlecore and you spent the night in.
