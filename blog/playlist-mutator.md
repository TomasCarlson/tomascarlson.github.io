Like many other people, I'm obsessed with playlists. If I hear a song I like, my mind instantly races to what boxes the track ticks so I can move it to the playlist that matches it the best. My time DJing on the radio made me even more conscientious about making sure that songs in a tracklist complement each other; a mark of a good show is one where the tracks have a specific flow to each other or an underlying theme.

By the end of the season, I had this categorization down to a science. I noticed that above genre or any other factor, two variables played into a particular grouping of track's flow more than anything else: energy and mood. With each episode of my show, the tracklist always surrounded a distinct sound, but there was a unique flow to each episode since I essentially morphed those two variables with my tracklists.

With all the strides music recommendations taken, why wasn't there a way to do what I effectively did on my show and what I did with all my playlists automatically?

That's what I set out to do with [Playlist Mutator](https://playlistmutator.com/), utilizing Spotify's already powerful recommendation system to "mutate" your existing playlists: making happier, sadder, tamer, or more energetic versions of the playlists you love.
