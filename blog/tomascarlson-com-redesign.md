As I was finalizing Playlist Mutator, I realized I never checked up on my personal website (this one you're reading it on) in a while. It was the first website I made after years of not touching Visual Studio. Additionally, development began and finished the days before my first college class. Needless to say, it wasn't the best:

While the "image blocking" was an interesting idea in concept, it resulted in the page looking too busy and caused the site to functionally be a bit of a mess. Each block was all links, which made navigation a pain (the left half of the screen was all a mailto link!). The individual tabs carried the same motif, which meant super busy and non-descriptive overviews of projects hurt more than helped. Worst, the site was made in static HTML, so updating content was a pain and a half!

With more programming and design experience under my belt, I thought I would be doing myself a disservice if new Playlist Mutator users were to stumble upon my mess of a site. Using Gatsby.js and Netifly's CMS, I pulled together this complete rehaul from scratch. The new redesign is easier to navigate, easier to populate with new content, and most importantly, a little friendlier on the eyes. Hope you all enjoy it!
